JavaScript: A Powerful Programming Language
JavaScript is a dynamically typed programming language used to give instructions to the computer, primarily for creating interactive web applications. It is widely used in both front-end (web development) and back-end (server-side with Node.js) programming.


The basic execution flow of JavaScript:
Input (JavaScript Code) ---> Computer Processes It ---> Output (Result on Screen)


Alerts in JavaScript
Alerts are used to display pop-up messages to users. The alert() function pauses script execution until the user dismisses it.

Example: alert("Hello there!");

Variables in JavaScript
Variables are containers for data that store values such as numbers, strings, and objects. They allow data to be reused and manipulated throughout the program.

Declaring Variables
JavaScript provides three ways to declare variables:

var – Old way (Function-scoped, avoid using)
let – Block-scoped, can be reassigned
const – Block-scoped, cannot be reassigned

let name = "Akhil";  // String
const pi = 3.14;     // Number (constant)
var isStudent = true; // Boolean


Assignment Operator (=)
The = operator is used to assign values to variables.
let age = 25; // Assigning 25 to the variable age

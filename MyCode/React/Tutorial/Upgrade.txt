Upgrading to React 18

If you are using an older version of React, you can upgrade to React 18 by following these steps:

Step 1: Install React 18

Run the following command in your project folder:

npm i react@latest react-dom@latest

Step 2: Use the New Root API

To take advantage of React 18's concurrent features, update the root rendering method in index.js:

Before:

import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));

After:

import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);

Your application will still work without using the new root API, but it will behave like React 17 if you continue using ReactDOM.render.

What's Next?

Now that you have a React environment on your computer, you are ready to learn more about React.

If you want to follow along, start by simplifying your src folder to contain only index.js. It should look like this:

Example:

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

const myFirstElement = <h1>Hello React!</h1>;

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(myFirstElement);

This will serve as the foundation for building more complex React applications.

Introduction

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is widely used to build single-page applications and allows developers to create reusable UI components.

How Does React Work?

React creates a Virtual DOM in memory. Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React updates the Virtual DOM first and then syncs only the necessary changes to the real DOM. This process makes React fast and efficient.

Learning by Examples

Our "Show React" tool makes it easy to demonstrate React. It shows both the code and the result.



import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

function Hello(props) {
  return <h1>Hello World!</h1>;
}

const container = document.getElementById("root");
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(container);
root.render(<Hello />);

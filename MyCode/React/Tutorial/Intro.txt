Introduction

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is widely used to build single-page applications and allows developers to create reusable UI components.

Learning by Examples

Our "Show React" tool makes it easy to demonstrate React. It shows both the code and the result.


import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

function Hello(props) {
  return <h1>Hello World!</h1>;
}

const container = document.getElementById("root");
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(container);
root.render(<Hello />);

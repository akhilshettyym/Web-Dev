Setting Up React

To use React in production, you need npm, which is included with Node.js.

To get an overview of React, you can write React code directly in HTML. However, for production use, installing Node.js and npm is necessary.

React Directly in HTML

The quickest way to start learning React is to write React code directly in your HTML files.

Example:

Include three CDN links in your HTML file:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js" crossorigin></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js" crossorigin></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone/babel.min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="mydiv"></div>
    <script type="text/babel">
      function Hello() {
        return <h1>Hello World!</h1>;
      }
      const container = document.getElementById('mydiv');
      const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(container);
      root.render(<Hello />);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>

This method is fine for testing but not recommended for production.

Setting Up a React Environment

If you have npx and Node.js installed, you can create a React application using create-react-app.

Steps:

If you've previously installed create-react-app globally, uninstall it:
npm uninstall -g create-react-app

Create a new React app:
npx create-react-app my-react-app

Navigate to your project directory:
cd my-react-app

Start the application:
npm start

A new browser window will pop up with your React App. If not, visit localhost:3000.

Modifying a React Application

Locate the src/App.js file inside your React project. By default, it looks like this:

import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
        <p>
          Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
        </p>
        <a className="App-link" href="https://reactjs.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          Learn React
        </a>
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}
export default App;

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
export default App;

What's Next?

Now that you have a React environment on your computer, you are ready to learn more about React.

If you want to follow along, start by simplifying your src folder to contain only index.js. It should look like this:

Example:

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

const myFirstElement = <h1>Hello React!</h1>;

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(myFirstElement);

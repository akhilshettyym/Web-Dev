Comments in JavaScript
Comments in JavaScript are used to explain code, improve readability, and temporarily disable parts of the code. JavaScript ignores comments during execution.

1️⃣ Single-Line Comments (//)
Used for brief explanations or to disable a single line of code.
Starts with // and extends to the end of the line.

// This is a single-line comment
console.log("Hello, World!"); // Prints to the console

// let name = "John"; // This line is commented out and won't execute
console.log("JavaScript Comments"); 

2️⃣ Multi-Line Comments (/ /)
Used for detailed explanations spanning multiple lines.
Starts with /* and ends with */.

/* 
   This is a multi-line comment.
   It can be used to explain complex logic 
   or temporarily disable multiple lines of code.
*/
console.log("This will run"); 

/*
console.log("This will not run");
console.log("Because it's inside a multi-line comment");
*/

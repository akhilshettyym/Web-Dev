Comments in JavaScript
Comments in JavaScript are used to explain code, improve readability, and temporarily disable parts of the code. JavaScript ignores comments during execution.

1️⃣ Single-Line Comments (//)
Used for brief explanations or to disable a single line of code.
Starts with // and extends to the end of the line.

// This is a single-line comment
console.log("Hello, World!"); // Prints to the console

// let name = "John"; // This line is commented out and won't execute
console.log("JavaScript Comments"); 

2️⃣ Multi-Line Comments (/ /)
Used for detailed explanations spanning multiple lines.
Starts with /* and ends with */.

/* 
   This is a multi-line comment.
   It can be used to explain complex logic 
   or temporarily disable multiple lines of code.
*/
console.log("This will run"); 

/*
console.log("This will not run");
console.log("Because it's inside a multi-line comment");
*/

3️⃣ Uses of Comments in JavaScript
✅ Code Documentation – Helps developers understand the code.
✅ Debugging – Temporarily disable parts of the code.
✅ Collaboration – Useful when working in teams to describe logic.

Operators in JavaScript
Operators in JavaScript are used to perform operations on variables and values. They can be classified into different types based on their functionality.

1️⃣ Arithmetic Operators (Used for mathematical calculations)
Operator	                    Description	Example	Result
+	Addition	                5 + 3	8
-	Subtraction	                10 - 4	6
*	Multiplication	            6 * 2	12
/	Division	                10 / 2	5
%	Modulus (Remainder)	        10 % 3	1
**	Exponentiation	            2 ** 3	8
++	Increment	                let x = 5; x++;	6
--	Decrement	                let y = 5; y--;	4

2️⃣ Assignment Operators (Used to assign values to variables)
Operator	                                Description	Example	Equivalent to
=	Assign	                                x = 5	x = 5
+=	Add and assign	                        x += 3	x = x + 3
-=	Subtract and assign	                    x -= 2	x = x - 2
*=	Multiply and assign	                    x *= 4	x = x * 4
/=	Divide and assign	                    x /= 2	x = x / 2
%=	Modulus and assign	                    x %= 3	x = x % 3
**=	Exponentiation and assign	            x **= 2	x = x ** 2

3️⃣ Comparison Operators (Used to compare values)
Operator	                                Description	Example	Result
==	Equal to	                             == "5"	true
===	Strict equal (checks type too)	        5 === "5"	false
!=	Not equal	                            10 != 5	true
!==	Strict not equal	                    10 !== "10"	true
>	Greater than	                        10 > 5	true
<	Less than	                            5 < 10	true
>=	Greater than or equal	                10 >= 10	true
<=	Less than or equal	                    5 <= 3	false


4️⃣ Logical Operators (Used to combine boolean values)
Operator	Description	Example	Result
&&	AND (both true)	true && false	false
`		`	OR (one true)
!	NOT (negation)	!true	false
